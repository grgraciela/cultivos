<h2>Conclution</h2>
   <p> We are natural fourth year students. We have been doing a project, with differents teachers, related to gardens and organic crops. An informative talk has been heard by us on how to grow and maintain these crops, and also how to make pesticides. After that we did what, we learned in the Villa San Ignacio how to plant seeds. The arugula seeds, grew after some months, but the onions didn't. We believe that they didn't grow because of the extremely cold weather. So, we don't know if the insecticides we prepared were effective</p>
